                    <p>
                        Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow across borders. Where
                        countries lower taxes, reduce red tape, and eliminate road blocks. Where companies import goods
                        and merchandise directly into a Free Trade Zone - and then ship products out duty free.</p>

                       <p> The Miami Free Trade Zone connects North America, Europe and Asia to Latin America and the
                        Caribbean via direct air and sea transportation links, plus rail and expressway. Operated by FTZ
                        World Services, the 47-acre Zone (#372) saves companies money and time.</p>
